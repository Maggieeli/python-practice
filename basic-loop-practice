# 1. Create a loop that will print out the numbers 5 - 100, counting by 5. While and for.

for list in range(5,101,+5):
    print(list)

number = 5
while number <= 100:
    print(number)
    number += 5

# 2. Create a loop that will add up all the numbers from 1-10.

total = 0
for number in range(1,11):
    total += number
print(total)

total = 0
number = 1

while number <= 10:
    total += number
    number+= 1
print(total)

# 3. Create a loop that will take user input, add all the even numbers, subtract all
#    the odd numbers and stop when you input 'done'.

'''
    When writing out a list of items in English, one normally separates the items with
    commas. In addition, the word “and” is normally included before the last item, unless
    the list only contains one item. 
    Consider the following four lists:
        apples
        apples and oranges
        apples, oranges and bananas
        apples, oranges, bananas and lemons
    
    Write a function that takes a list of strings as its only parameter. Your function
    should return a string that contains all of the items in the list formatted in the manner
    described previously as its only result. While the examples shown previously only
    include lists containing four elements or less, your function should behave correctly
    for lists of any length. Include a main program that reads several items from the user,
    formats them by calling your function, and then displays the result returned by the
    function.

        result = result + str(items[len(items) - 1])
        return result
